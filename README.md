# Trash Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the automatic detection and classification of different types of waste using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The primary objective is to facilitate efficient waste sorting, which can significantly improve recycling processes and environmental sustainability.

## Model Description

The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a class of deep learning algorithms particularly effective for image classification tasks. In this case, the CNN is trained to classify images of waste into four categories: glass, metal, plastic, and paper/cardboard.

### Key Features of the Model
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing the model is uploaded on Kaggle and includes images of different types of waste.
- **Classes**: The model classifies waste into four categories:
  - Glass
  - Metal
  - Plastic
  - Paper/Cardboard
- **Test-Train Split**: The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.
- **Model Architecture**: The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, designed to effectively extract features and classify images.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent, with techniques such as data augmentation and dropout to enhance performance and prevent overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Files in the Repository

- **`trash_detection_model_cnn.h5`**: This file contains the trained CNN model, which can be used to make predictions on new waste images.
- **`resultant.png`**: This image provides a visual representation of the model's predictions, showcasing the classification results.

## How to Use the Model

1. **Load the Model**: Load the `trash_detection_model_cnn.h5` file using a deep learning library such as TensorFlow or Keras.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Ensure that your input images are preprocessed in the same manner as the training data (e.g., resizing, normalization).
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the loaded model to make predictions on new waste images.
4. **Analyze Results**: Refer to `resultant.png` for a visual understanding of the model's predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using Convolutional Neural Networks for automated waste detection and classification. By accurately identifying different types of waste, this system can significantly improve the efficiency of recycling processes and contribute to environmental sustainability.

## Future Work

Future enhancements may include:
- Exploring more complex CNN architectures to improve classification accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset to include more types of waste.
- Developing a user interface for easy interaction with the model.
- Integrating the model into a real-time waste sorting system.
